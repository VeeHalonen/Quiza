<h2>Releases</h2>

**[Release 1 (2021-04-25)](https://github.com/VeeHalonen/Quiza/tree/a98aa8d7e880f290515be996b317136ca1fc02d7): Features**

The apps opens to the "New Quiz with Options" screen.

The user can choose the number of questions asked (10, 20, or 50) and quiz difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, or All). The questions are multiple choice with four options and one correct answer.

The app keeps track of the user's points and gives the correct answer after an incorrect option is chosen. The app also vibrates with a different pattern depending on whether the answer was correct. One long buzz means the answer was incorrect, two shorter ones indicate a correct answer.

After all the questions have been answered, the quiz ends. A recap screen is shown with the user's final points and a button to start a new quiz, which returns the user back to the options screen.
