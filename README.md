**v0.1 (2021/04/22): Barebones first release**

User is given 10 questions with multiple choice options to choose from.

Program keeps track of user's points and gives the correct answer after an incorrect option is chosen.

After 10 questions, the quiz ends and a recap screen is shown with the user's final points.

The quiz can be restarted from the recap screen.

No styling. Uglier than a 90s website.
